Splunk Data Handling and Deployment Strategies: A Detailed Briefing

This briefing document summarizes the key concepts and practical considerations for handling data and deploying Splunk, drawing from the provided transcript of a "Dive into SPL Search Processing Language" session.
I. Core Concepts of Data Handling in Splunk

Splunk processes data through a four-stage lifecycle, essential for transforming raw, unstructured logs into searchable insights:

    Data Inputs: This is the initial stage where Splunk is configured to identify and monitor specific data sources. As stated, "Here we define generally... what file we need to monitor." This often involves specifying log files (e.g., .log files) or network ports. For instance, to monitor system logs, the path /var/log/syslog would be configured.
    Data Parsing: Once ingested, data, often in "unstructured or semi-structured format," is "converted into a proper structured format." This process makes the data understandable and usable by Splunk for subsequent analysis.
    Indexing: After parsing, the data is "basically storing the data." This involves writing the structured data to disk, allowing for efficient retrieval. The process of storing is also referred to as "storing/indexing."
    Data Searching: This final stage is where users interact with the indexed data. As explained, it's "where you search your data, where you type index equals to something."

II. Splunk Deployment Types

Splunk offers various deployment architectures to cater to different organizational needs and scales. The three main types discussed are:

    Standalone Deployment:

    Definition: In a standalone deployment, "all these four aspects [inputs, parsing, indexing, searching] are happening in a single instance." It's characterized as a "one-man army" where a single Splunk instance handles all data processing tasks.
    Example: The bootcamp instance used in the session, where files were uploaded, parsed, stored, and searched on a single machine, exemplifies a standalone deployment.
    Limitations: While suitable for basic requirements, standalone deployments lack high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.

    Distributed Deployment:

    Definition: This architecture distributes the four data handling aspects among different Splunk components.
    Components:Forwarders: These agents are installed on data sources (e.g., servers) and are responsible for "collecting the data... and sending it to Splunk or indexers." They handle the "data inputs." Universal Forwarders are described as "software which you put into your servers" and are a "whole different package" from a full Splunk installation.
    Indexers: These components receive data from forwarders and are responsible for "parsing and indexing the data." Splunk is installed and configured on indexers to accept forwarded data.
    Search Head: This component is dedicated to data searching, allowing users to query the indexed data.
    Benefit: Distributes tasks, improving performance and scalability compared to standalone.
    Limitation: A key drawback of distributed deployment is that "it does not it did not had high availability or disaster recovery."

    Clustered Deployment:

    Definition: This is the "widely used in production production environment" due to its robust features. It builds upon distributed deployment by introducing redundancy and load balancing. A "cluster" is defined as "a group of something."
    Key Features:High Availability & Disaster Recovery: Unlike distributed deployments, clustered deployments inherently offer "high availability and disaster recovery."
    Data Replication: When data arrives from forwarders to indexers, "by default three copies of raw data will be created" and distributed among indexers. This ensures that "even if any indexers goes down, the other two will... carry forward the task."
    Indexer Cluster: A "group of indexer" provides redundancy for data storage and indexing.
    Search Head Cluster: A "group of search" instances, often combined with a "load balancer," manages concurrent user requests. This prevents a single search head from crashing if "500 users" attempt to access it simultaneously. The load balancer "distribut[es] evenly amongst all the three or... four members of cluster."
    Relevance: Preferred for production environments due to its resilience against outages and ability to handle high user loads.

III. Key Factors Determining Deployment Type

When designing a Splunk architecture for a client, several critical factors must be considered:

    Indexing Volume: The "amount of data you want to ingest" daily (e.g., "500 GB per day"). This directly impacts the required indexing capacity.
    Number and Types of Searches:

    Scheduled Searches: Searches "schedule[d] to run at a particular time."
    Ad Hoc Searches: Searches "run whenever we do index equals to something," or "searching right away."
    The expected frequency and complexity of both types of searches influence search head capacity.

    Number of Concurrent Users: This is a crucial factor for determining the necessity of a search head cluster. If "the number of concurrent users is just 50, then only one search can handle this load. But if your number number of concurrent users is greater than 100 then of course you will require more than one search."
    Data Fidelity Requirements: The need to ensure "no data loss despite of being any anything... outage or... data center falls off." Clustered deployments inherently address this through data replication.
    Availability Requirements: Ensuring that data is "always available." Clustered deployments significantly contribute to meeting this requirement.
    Disaster Recovery Requirements: The ability to "switch all the requests to another environment" in case of a total outage. This often involves creating "active and passive" or "active active" environments, where "if active goes down the whole environment goes down then this passive environment which is ideal can take over all the requests coming."

IV. Practical Steps for Ingesting Real-Time Data using a Universal Forwarder

The session includes a practical demonstration of ingesting real-time data using a Universal Forwarder. Key steps involve:

    Install Splunk Package on Indexer/Search Head: (Assumed to be already done on the "Splunk bootcamp" instance).
    Install Universal Forwarder on a Separate Server:

    A new EC2 instance (e.g., "UFA") running Ubuntu is created.
    The Splunk Universal Forwarder package (DEB format for Ubuntu) is downloaded from splunk.com.
    The package is extracted and installed using dpkg -i <package_name>.
    The forwarder service is started using ./splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes.

    Configure Universal Forwarder (Inputs & Outputs):

    Navigate to the forwarder's app directory: /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps/search/local/.
    inputs.conf: This file tells the forwarder what to monitor.
    Example content:
    [monitor:///var/log/syslog]
    disabled = 0
    index = anime
    sourcetype = syslog
    The index specified (e.g., anime) must correspond to an index created on the Splunk receiving instance. A new index can be created via Splunk UI: Settings > Indexes > New Index.
    outputs.conf: This file tells the forwarder where to send the data.
    Example content:
    [tcpout]
    defaultGroup = default-autolb-group

    [tcpout:default-autolb-group]
    server = <IP_ADDRESS_OF_SPLUNK_BOOTCAMP>:9997
    The server IP address should be the public IP of the Splunk instance (indexer/search head) that will receive the data.
    The default port for Splunk forwarder communication is 9997 (TCP).

    Configure Splunk Receiver:

    On the Splunk instance where data is to be received, configure a receiving port.
    Splunk UI: Settings > Forwarding and Receiving > Add new receiving port.
    Add 9997 as the new receiving port.

    Restart Splunk Service on Forwarder:

    ./splunk restart (within /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/) to apply the configuration changes.

    Verify Data Ingestion:

    On the Splunk UI, search for the newly created index: index=anime.
    The data from the forwarder's monitored log file (e.g., /var/log/syslog) should now be visible, with the host identified as the forwarder's IP or hostname.

V. Key Takeaways and Q&A Highlights

    Standalone vs. Enterprise: "Enterprise is a product and standalone is an instance where you will do... all your things on just one instance." Standalone is an "architecture type," not a version.
    License Acceptance: Splunk license acceptance is a one-time process upon initial installation.
    Disk Space Management: Disk space is freed up by changing data retention policies (e.g., discarding data after 90 days). Data can also be archived.
    EC2 Instance as Forwarder: An EC2 instance can host a forwarder, but the bootcamp instance itself is a "standalone instance" for demonstration purposes.
    Peer Nodes: Indexers are referred to as "peer nodes" when a search head accesses data from them.
    Port Numbers: Port numbers (e.g., 9997) for Splunk communication can be changed, but consistency is required across outputs.conf on the forwarder and receiving port configurations on the Splunk instance. Port numbers are not OS-dependent.
    Monitoring Network Logs: Splunk can monitor specific network ports (e.g., TCP port 5154) where network logs are being forwarded.
    Universal Forwarder Installation: A universal forwarder cannot be installed on the same instance as a full Splunk installation; they must reside on different instances.
    Deployment Server: Used to manage configurations on Universal Forwarders, especially in large-scale environments. This topic was considered "too advanced" for the basic scope of the session.
