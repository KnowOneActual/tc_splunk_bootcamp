## Choosing the right text editor is an important step, and `vim` can be very confusing at first.

## Here is a guide that covers the absolute basics of `vim` and then shows how to install and use `nano` as a simpler alternative.

## A Quick Guide to Command-Line Editors

### The Classic: A Basic Guide to Using Vim

**Vim** is a powerful and efficient editor, but it operates differently from most modern editors. The key is understanding its "modes."

  * **Normal Mode**: When you first open a file, you are in Normal mode. You **cannot** type text in this mode. Instead, you use keyboard keys to execute commands (like saving, quitting, or deleting lines).
  * **Insert Mode**: This is the mode you use for typing and editing text, just like in a normal editor.

Hereâ€™s how to perform the most common tasks:

**1. Opening or Creating a File**

```bash
# This opens an existing file or creates a new one if it doesn't exist
vim filename.txt
```

**2. Editing a File**

  * Once the file is open, press the `i` key to enter **Insert Mode**.
  * You will see **`-- INSERT --`** at the bottom of the screen. Now you can type and edit text as you normally would.

**3. Saving and Quitting**

This is the part that trips up most new users. All of these commands are run from **Normal Mode**.

  * First, press the **`Esc`** key to exit Insert Mode and return to Normal Mode. The `-- INSERT --` text will disappear.
  * Next, type a colon (`:`) to open the command-line at the bottom of the screen.
  * Here are the essential commands:
      * `:w` - **w**rite (save) the file but don't close it.
      * `:q` - **q**uit the editor. (This will fail if you have unsaved changes).
      * `:wq` - **w**rite (save) the file **and** then **q**uit. This is the most common way to save and exit.
      * `:q!` - **q**uit without saving any changes. The `!` forces it to discard changes.

### The Friendly Alternative: Using Nano

**Nano** is a much more intuitive and user-friendly editor for beginners. The commands are always visible at the bottom of the screen.

**1. Installing Nano**

On a fresh Ubuntu Server install, you may need to install it first.

```bash
# Update your package list
sudo apt update

# Install nano
sudo apt install nano
```

**2. Opening or Creating a File**

It works just like `vim`.

```bash
# This opens an existing file or creates a new one
nano filename.txt
```

**3. Editing a File**

  * Unlike `vim`, `nano` opens directly into editing mode. You can start typing immediately. There are no separate modes to worry about.

**4. Saving and Quitting**

  * The commands are listed at the bottom of the screen. The `^` symbol represents the **`Ctrl`** key.
      * To save and exit, press **`Ctrl + X`** (for "Exit").
      * Nano will ask you if you want to save the modified buffer. Type **`Y`** for Yes.
      * It will then ask you to confirm the file name. Just press **`Enter`**.
  * That's it\! The file is saved, and you're back at the command prompt.
